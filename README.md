## Description

A blog front end as part of my MERN project. Technologies employed: vite, react, redux-toolkit, sass.

## Main learning outcomes

- SASS fundamentals 
- Redux for state management, primarily async requests using thunks (extra reducers for handling pending, fullfilled and rejected).
- React router.
- Form validation.
